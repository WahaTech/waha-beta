subheader: "WaHa Tech has quickly become America’s largest company scaling carbon negative bitcoin mining solutions through clean energy investments. As the world and energy sectors change rapidly, our team’s strong environmental values and deep knowledge of investing, cryptocurrencies, clean technology R&D, the tech sector and artificial intelligence have given WaHa an opportunity to expand rapidly in its two year existence. Our portfolio of companies work to meld the quickly changing, decentralized world of clean energy with cryptocurrency mining. We are cleaning up traditionally carbon-heavy industries (such as flared gas and plasma gasification)  and using stranded energy from sources such as nuclear power to mine bitcoin. Our Georgia-based stranded energy nuclear facilities mine four bitcoin per day, and are expected to increase output by 200% over the coming year. 

Founded in 2019, we have grown from a small stranded energy from nuclear power to a vertically integrated, muti-sector company with increasingly diversified and balanced investments in clean technology and decentralized currency."
